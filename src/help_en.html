                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Welcome to the Picopico Sequencer!<br>
                Picopico Sequencer is a Flash-free and purely HTML5 written music sequencer. It describes music in MML and has a piano-roll-style
                visualization. Even though it is not implemented as of now, it will have the ability to edit music with GUI.<br>
                The Japanese term "Picopico" generally refers to the sounds produced by the traditional video game consoles such as the Family Computer and
                Super Family Computer(SFC), which are also known as NES and SNES in English-speaking countries. So the name "Picopico Sequencer" suggests that
                the program can only produce such eh...(I don't know how it can be described in English) primitive sounds.<br>
                However, there is a way to break the limit, which is explained later.

                <h2>Basics</h2>
                <p>Picopico Sequencer is a web-based music sequencer which uses MML for music notation. That means that you must first write some
                MML source in order for it to play some music. For a brief tour of MML, see sample sources on the server. For the grammar of MML
                itself, see the following grammar reference.

                <h2>Quick reference for MML grammar</h2>
                <p>As you might know, MML has many dialects. It is often the case that although some two music sequencers are said to use the
                same MML processor, they actually have slightly different syntaxes and commands. So the following refereces may contain informations
                only valid for Picopico Sequencer.

                    <ul>
                        <li>() : Represents arguments. Unlike the programming languages, you don't need to write the parentheses in MML source.<br>
                            It also represents a group of characters referring to commands.
                        </li>
                        <li>[] : Suggests that it can be ommited.</li>

                        <li>xxx-xxx : Indicates a range of letters, numbers etc.</li>
                        <li>XXX : Letters in capital refer to commands and those letters have to be put in MML source as they are.<br>
                            Note that the case is not significant.(So xxx and XXX refer to the same command.)

                        <p>A note, which is an "atom" in musical notation, is notated as a letter.
                        </p>
                        <p>With followed by any of the following signs "!","#","+","-", the note is treated like notes with sharps or flats.
                        Each sign represents a "natural", "sharp", "sharp" and "flat" respectively and can be followed by other accidentals.
                        </p>
                        <p>The note command can take additional three arguments. The first represents the step time which is the duration in which
                        the note should be played. It usually takes a note value. And it is worth noting that if step is ommitted the default
                        value set by a "L" command will be applied.<br>
                        In addition, you can express "step" in ticks instead of a note value. What is notated in ticks can be written like
                        "*some_number".<br>
                        Furthermore you can lengthen the duration by adding "^"(circumflex) and an extra duration.<br>
                        And dots after the step time lengthen the note duration by half the preceding number.
                        </p>
                        <p>The second parameter called "gate" refers to the gate time which is the real duration in which the note will be played.
                        </p>
                        <p>Finally the last named "velocity" literally means the velocity which is equivalent to the volume in Picopico Sequencer.
